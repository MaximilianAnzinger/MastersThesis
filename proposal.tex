\subsection{Competency Management Improvements}
% flag competencies & exercises/units as optional
% bundel exercises (different difficulties)
To allow for individual learning paths, instructors must be able to configure competencies in more detail. Firstly, instructors should be
able to bundle exercises that represent a variety of different difficulty levels, s.t. the learning path generation can lateron cater exercises
with an appropriate complexity to the individual students.

Furthermore, instructors should be able to flag compentencies or specific exercises as optional material. Therefore, ambitious students' learning paths
may incorporate these tasks to maintain the relatively high level of difficulty that these students may expect to keep them motivated.
On the other hand, the learning path system can ommit these exercises for students that fall behind and provide alternative resources to allow them
to reiterate and gain more confidence with the required learning material.
It should be noted, that both of the before mentioned features should exclude exercises that contribute towards the course score.

Finally, insturctors should be able to configure deadlines for individual competencies. Therefore, students can get feedback if they are on track with the
expected progress.

\subsection{Learning Path Generation}
Once a student enrolls in a course, the system should create an individual learning path. The

The system should provide reccomendations,

\subsection{Student View}
Students must be able to view their progress in their individual learning path. There should be an intuitive representation of the already completed and upcoming tasks.
Furthermore, students should be able to review wheather their progression is within the instructors expections in regards of time. Further feedback indicators
representing the students performance compared to other enrolled students might be beneficial to promote self-regulatory learning.
The overview should also incorporate the reccomendation made by the learning path generation. Hence, students spend less time choosing their next task and can fluently
continue througout their learning experience.

\subsection{Learning Analytics}
The application must incorporate a dashboard for instructors to analyze the progress of the participating students. To review the effectiveness of the learning material,
instructors need access to indicators, such as average completion of competencies, average participation in exercises, and average score of exercises.
Furthermore, insturctors should be able to get insight into individual students' learning path to allow for individual feedback.


\section{Schedule}
\missing{ Thesis Schedule
        \begin{itemize}
                \item When will the thesis Start (Always 15th of Month)
                \item Create a rough plan for your thesis (separate the time in sprints with a length of 2-4 Weeks)
                \item Each sprint should contain several work items - Again keep it high-level and make to keep your plan realistic
                \item Make sure the work-items are measurable and deliverable
                \item No writing related tasks! (e.g. "Write Analysis Chapter")
        \end{itemize}
